## Introduction
Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause respiratory illness in humans. They are called ‚Äúcorona‚Äù because of crown-like spikes on the surface of the virus. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the common cold are examples of coronaviruses that cause illness in humans.
The new strain of coronavirus ‚Äî SARS-CoV-2 ‚Äî was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. It has since spread to every country around the world. 
Coronaviruses are often found in bats, cats and camels. The viruses live in but don‚Äôt infect the animals. Sometimes these viruses then spread to different animal species. The viruses may change (mutate) as they transfer to other species. Eventually, the virus can jump from animal species and begin to infect humans. In the case of SARS-CoV-19, the first people infected are thought to have contracted the virus at a food market that sold meat, fish and live animals.
